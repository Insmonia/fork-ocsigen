### WARNING ###

Typing `make' in this directory should build both the preprocessor
 (lib/pa_deriving.cma and lib/pa_deriving_type_conv.cmo) and the libraries
 (lib/modules/deriving.cma, lib/modules/deriving.cmxa).

You can run the tests by changing to the test directory and building
and running the `tests' executable

   $ cd tests
   $ make
   ...
   $ ./tests
   Tests succeeded!

There's very limited documentation at present, but you should be able
to get started by looking at the test files.

Any comments are very welcome.
