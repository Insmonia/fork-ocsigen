0.2-ocsigen

  * Local version released only with ocsigen.

  * Prefix all module's name with 'Deriving_'.

  * Generate a META file to be used with ocamlfind.

  * Add a "type-conv" compatible mode.

  * Add a Json deriver, that serialise to and from a 'js_of_ocaml'
    value represention.

  * Use lazy first-class modules instead of recursives one in the
    generated code, and use functions of first-class modules instead
    of functors. It seems to handles more recursive type definition,
    and to allows a future extension that handles non-regular data
    types.

  * Handle polymorphic type in record's fields as an empty type.

  * regression: the Functor deriver doesn't compile yet.

  * Made Dump and Pickle interface compatible with each other and more
    compatible with Marshal.

  * Bugfix in the tag hash function on 64-bit platforms.

  * Fixed a bug with a functor application quotation that used revised
    syntax.
