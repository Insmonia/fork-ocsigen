    special chars (doc from MDC):

        Inserts the matched substring.
    - $`
        Inserts the portion of the string that precedes the matched substring.
    - $'
        Inserts the portion of the string that follows the matched substring.
    - $n or $nn  Where n or nn are decimal digits
        Inserts the nth parenthesized submatch string, provided the first argument was a RegExp object.
