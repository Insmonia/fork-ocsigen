(** [Eliom_event] is a module that allow one to use propagate events occurrences
    from the server to the client and the other way around. It is to be noted
    that occurrence propagation is done asynchronously.

    The use of this module is pretty much useless without it's client counter
    part: [Eliom_client_event]. *)

(* These two dual files are to be modified together
   with compatibility issues in mind. *)


module Down :
  (** A "Down event" (AKA down-going event) is an event which occurrences are
      transmitted asynchronously to the client. While named events, it might be
      better to consider them as asynchronous server-to-client edges in the
      event dependency graph.

      The return type of the [wrap]ing
      function gives insight about how Down events are handled internally, it is
      however taken care of automatically. *)
sig

  type 'a t
  (** The abstract type of down events. *)

  val of_react :
      ?throttling:float
    -> ?name:string
    -> 'a React.E.t
    -> 'a t
  (** [of_react ?throttling ?name e] create an
      asynchronous edge originating from [e]. The parameters are: [throttling]
      for the limit to event propagation rate, [name] for named edges. *)

  val wrap :
      'a t
    -> ( 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id * Eliom_common.unwrapper ) Eliom_client_types.data_key
  (** [wrap e] wraps the event [e] so that it can be handed to the client. *)

end

module Up :
  (** Up events are quite different from Down events. Because of the
      asymmetrical nature of web programming and because of the reactive model
      used, an Up event must be created on the server and wrapped into a
      callback (or something the client can build a callback with).
    *)
sig

  type 'a t
  (** The type of events that, while being "on the server", are triggered by
      clients. On the server such an event is /primitive/ (hence the [create]
      function) whereas it is /effect-full/ on the client. *)

  val to_react : 'a t -> 'a React.E.t
  (** [to_react e] injects the up events [e] into react events so that it can
      be manipulated as a standard event. *)

  val wrap :
       'a t
    -> (unit, 'a, [ `Nonattached of [ `Post ] Eliom_services.na_s ],
        [ `WithoutSuffix ], unit,
        [ `One of 'a Eliom_parameters.caml ] Eliom_parameters.param_name,
        [ `Registrable ], Eliom_output.Action.return)
         Eliom_services.service Eliom_client_types.data_key
  (** [wrap e] wraps [e] into a wrapped service. This result is to be handled by
      the [Eliom_client_event.Up.unwrap] function. *)

  val create :
       ?scope:Eliom_common.scope
    -> ?name:string
    -> ('a, [ `WithoutSuffix ],
        [ `One of 'a Eliom_parameters.caml ] Eliom_parameters.param_name)
         Eliom_parameters.params_type
    -> 'a t
  (** [create param] creates an Up event.
      If [~name] is present, the coservice used to transmit the event will
      always have the same name, even if the server is restarted.
      [~scope] describes the visibility of the event. By default, it is
      [`Global] if it is called during initialisation,
      [`Client_process] otherwise.
