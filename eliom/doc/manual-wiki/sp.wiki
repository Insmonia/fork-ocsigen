= Implicit server parameters

Starting from version 1.90, the server parameters are no more
explicitely passed as parameters. They are stored in Lwt's new local
thread storage mechanism.

Server parameters are only available in two place:
* during initialisation of a site ;
* during a request processing.

If your program failed with {{{"Server parameters not available
here"}}}, here a list of common mistakes.
