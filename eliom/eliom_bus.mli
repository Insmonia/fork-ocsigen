type 'a t
(** The type of bus's carrying values of type ['a]. Bus's are values
    that can be easily shared among clients. Each of these clients
    along with the server can send a value on the bus. Values can be
    received by each of the participants as a stream. Note that no
    effort is put to order message receptions on the different
    participants. *)

val create :
  ?scope:Eliom_common.scope -> ?name:string -> ?size:int
  -> 'a Deriving_Json.t
  -> 'a t
(** [create ?scope ?name] makes a fresh bus. The [name] optional
    parameter can be used to make persistent (as in server restart
    persistent) bus's. The [scope] argument is passed to the
    underlying service creation function. The [?name] argument allow
    one to make bus's persistent over server restart. *)

val stream : 'a t -> 'a Lwt_stream.t
(** [stream b] returns the stream of datas sent to bus [b]. Notice you
    sould not use that function multiple times on the same bus, it will
    return the same stream. If you want to receive mutiple times the
    same datas, you sould copy the stream with [Lwt_stream.clone] *)

val write : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [write b x] sends the value [x] on the bus [b]. Every participant,
    including the server, will receive [x]. *)
