steps to uneliomification :) :
 - get orig graffity to compile (need install latest version of ocsigen/eliom)
 - rename graffiti to app, and have a simple var/, and run commands
   to compile manually (simple Makefile)
 - 

** before eliom 2.0 (and eliomc):

was tutorial/files/multi_graffity_v1/. I've renamed common.ml to shared.ml
cleaned-up the Makefile, and move config in config/. I've also removed
many 'open'.
